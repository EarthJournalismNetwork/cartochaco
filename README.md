# CartoChaco
In 2014, Internews’ Earth Journalism Network (EJN) developed CartoChaco, the first multimedia journalistic and data hub of information about this critical and endangered region, with InfoAmazonia, Terra-i, and Asociación Guyra.

The platform was built in WordPress with a [fork of the JEO theme](https://github.com/EarthJournalismNetwork/jeo/tree/cartochaco). In 2021, the website was flattened and all the content was uploaded to this repository. The URL CartoChaco.com is now pointing to this repository via GitHub Pages.
